"""Feature-set selection is a real parameter (Part C.2 / Finding 1).

These are pure width/layout checks that need no Genesis sim: they exercise the
`feature_dim`/`feature_layout`/`resolve_feature_set` surface the env sizes its
state buffer from (`base_env.py`), so a regression that silently ignores the
selected `FeatureSet` (the original Finding 1 bug) fails here.
