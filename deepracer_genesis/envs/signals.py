"""The signal bus: a lazy, typed, tagged namespace of world quantities (Part K.1).

One shared pool of independently-computed signals that every consumer — the
feature vector, the reward, and (later) the cost — reads from. Each signal is a
small function with metadata; nothing is a god object and nothing is eagerly
computed:

- **Lazy + per-step cache**: a signal is computed on first read and cached until
  the next ``_post_physics`` calls :meth:`SignalBus.invalidate`. A run that never
  reads ``curvature_ahead`` never pays for it.
- **Single source of the driving-frame convention**: signals return the values
  the env already computed in ``_post_physics`` (``lateral``/``heading_err``/
  ``d_progress`` are already ``dir_sign``-corrected), so there is no parallel
  copy and no scattered ``·dir_sign`` re-application.

This module is the K.1 foundation. K.2 (features as signal selections), K.3
(config-routed actor/critic keys), and K.4 (reward+cost as signal combinations)
consume this bus.
