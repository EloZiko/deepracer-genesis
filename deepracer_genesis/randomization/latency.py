"""Temporal camera DR: observation latency + frame drop (Part P.2).

Unlike the per-frame effects in :mod:`~deepracer_genesis.randomization.image_aug`,
latency is *stateful* — the frame a policy sees this step depends on earlier
frames — so it lives in a small object the env advances once per step, not in the
stateless ``apply_image_aug`` pipeline.

Motivation (from the sim2real DR study): a real DeepRacer camera adds a
1-2 frame pipeline delay and occasionally repeats a stale frame, and for a 4 m/s
car that latency is likely the single largest untreated sim2real gap. The sim
renders with zero delay, so we inject it here.

    Emits the frame from ``latency`` steps ago (0 = current), then with

    respawned car starts from its fresh frame with no cross-episode bleed.

    The frame history is sized lazily on the first :meth:`advance` call, so the
    image resolution need not be known at construction.
